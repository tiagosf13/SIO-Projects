## Usage


Here are the key functionalities and usage instructions for the platform:

1. **Sign Up**: To create a user account, click on the Sign Up option and provide your email address, username, and password. We ensure the security of your account by implementing Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) via email verification.
2. **Login**: If you already have an account, simply enter your credentials to log in. We prioritize your account's security by utilizing Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for authentication purposes.
3. **Recover Password**: In case you forget your password, navigate to the Recover Password page and enter your registered email address. Your password reset instructions will be sent to your email.
4. **Statement Imports**: You can import statements exclusively from Santander (.xls) and/or Caixa Geral de Depósitos (.csv) formats. Please note that any other CSV or Excel files will not be accepted for upload.
5. **Statement Analysis**: The platform autonomously performs an analysis of your statements. Once the analysis is complete, you can access internal and external reports of your expenses and revenue. This information is also available on the Statement page of the platform.
6. **Chat**: To utilize the chat functionality, click on the chat icon located at the bottom right corner of the Portfolio page. If you are not entering an existing chat room, you will need to create a new one. Please be aware that chat rooms with no active members will be automatically deleted, along with their messages.
7. **Calendar**: The calendar feature is managed by specialists, and initially, new users will not have any events scheduled on it. It serves as a centralized tool for important financial dates and events.
8. **Inactivity**: To ensure security and optimal usage, the platform has a 10-minute inactivity timeout. If there is no interaction within this timeframe, your session will expire, and you will be automatically logged off.
